# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.10...HEAD)

## [0.7.11](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.10...0.7.11)

* Upgrade `near-indexer-primitives` to `0.28.0` (nearcore-2.4.0)
* Updated `FastNearClient` to include `authorization_token` in the headers


## [0.7.10](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.9...0.7.10)

* Upgrade `near-indexer-primitives` to `0.27.0` (nearcore-2.3.0)
* Added new provider `fastnear` - a new way to get the data from NEAR Protocol. It is a separate service that provides the data in a more efficient way. Check the [FastNear](https://fastnear.com/) and [Near Data Server](https://github.com/fastnear/neardata-server/) to get more details about provider.

### Breaking Change

* `s3_fetchers` rename to `fetchers` and move to the `providers` module. New usage example:
  ```rust
  use near_lake_framework::s3::fetchers::fetch_streamer_message;
  use near_lake_framework::fastnear::fetchers::fetch_streamer_message;
  ```
* `s3_client` rename to `client` and move to the `providers` module. New usage example:
  ```rust
  use near_lake_framework::S3Client;
  use near_lake_framework::FastNearClient;
  ```

## [0.7.9](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.7...0.7.9)

* Upgrade `near-indexer-primitives` to `0.23.0` (nearcore-1.40.0)
* Expose `s3_client::S3Client` trait so that custom S3 client implementations can be configured via `LakeConfigBuilder::s3_client`

### Breaking Change

* Errors returned from public `s3_fetcher` methods have changed slightly to support the newly exposed `S3Client`. As these methods serve a rare use-case this is only a minor bump.

## [0.7.7](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.6...0.7.7)

* Refactor `s3_fetchers` module to allow use `list_block_heights` outside of the framework

## [0.7.6](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.5...0.7.6)

* Upgrade `near-indexer-primitives` to `0.20.0`
* Upgrade dependencies versions to the latest

## [0.7.5](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.3...0.7.5)

* Refactor `s3_fetchers` module to allow exposing the underlying functionality:
  * `s3_fetchers::fetch_block` (without retrying)
  * `s3_fetchers::fetch_shard` (without retrying)

## [0.7.4](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.2...0.7.4)

* Upgrade all `aws` crates to the latest version
* Undeylying AWS error will now be printed

## [0.7.3](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.2...0.7.3)

* Expose `s3_fetchers` module to allow using the underlying functionality in other projects
* Minor refactoring of `s3_fetchers` module

## [0.7.2](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.1...0.7.2)

- Upgrade near primitives crate to `0.17.0`
- Upgrade `tokio` version to the latest (`1.28.2`)

## [0.7.1](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.7.0...0.7.1)

- Refactor `s3_fetchers` to allow testing
- Fix `betanet` default region (the corresponding bucket is in different region)

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.6.1...0.7.0)

- Add support for Meta Transactions [NEP-366](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0366.md) by upgrading `near-indexer-primitives` to `0.16`
- Add helper function for connecting to `betanet` lake

### Breaking change

- `Delegate` action has been introduced in `near-primitives::views::ActionView`, this should be handled everywhere you are handling `ActionView`

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.6.0...0.6.1)

- Fix of possible silent stops of the streamer (firing logs and returning errors where necessary)
- Fix the issue the streamer was always 1 block behind
- Renamed a few internal methods to reflect what they do
- Added debug and error logs in a few places
- Introduced a `LakeError` enum using `thiserror` (#42), but not exposing it yet to avoid breaking changes to the framework (for now, it will be done in `0.7.0`)
- Added proper error handling in a few places
- Updated the dependencies version of AWS crates

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.5.2...0.6.0)

- Upgrade underlying dependency `near-indexer-primitives` to versions between 0.15 and 0.16

### Breaking change

`near-indexer-primitives` reflects some breaking changes in the data types. Some of the fields that were previously
a base64-encoded String that now became raw `Vec<u8>`:

- `views::ActionView::FunctionCall.args`
- `views::QueryResponseKind::ViewState`
- `views::ExecutionStatusView::SuccessValue`

**Refer to this [`nearcore` commit](https://github.com/near/nearcore/commit/8e9be9fff4d520993c81b0e3738c0f223a9538c0) to find all the changes of this kind.**

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.5.1...0.5.2)

- Fixed the bug that caused a lag by 100 blocks that was introduced in 0.5.1

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1)

- Avoid spiky latency with streaming block heights preload

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) - 2022-06-16

- Cleaned up unused depdendencies
- Added the configuration option to control the size of the pool of
  preloaded blocks `blocks_preload_pool_size` (100 remains to be the default)
- Update AWS dependencies to `0.13.0`

### Breaking change

- Dropped the previously allowed way to instantiate LakeConfig by manually
  initializing the public fields in favor of
  [the builder pattern](https://docs.rs/near-lake-framework/0.4.1/near_lake_framework/struct.LakeConfigBuilder.html)

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2022-06-14

- Bumped the minimum required version of `serde_json` to 1.0.75 to avoid
  confusing errors when `arbitrary_precision` feature is enabled.
- Extended the list of supported near-primitives versions from 0.12.0
  to >=0.12.0,<0.15.0 to help downstream project avoid duplicate versions
  of near-primitives and its dependencies.
- Reduced verbosity level of recoverable errors from `ERROR` to `WARN`

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) - 2022-05-17

- Remove calls to `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` within the stream sender that
  could panic. Instead, a `Result` is returned from the sender task.
- Remove calls to `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` within `s3_fetchers` module

### Breaking change

- The `streamer()` function now returns a tuple, with the first element being a
  `JoinHandle<Result<(), Error>>` that you can use to gracefully capture any
  errors that occurred within the sender task. If you don't care about errors,
  you can easily adapt to this change by changing:
  ```rust
  let receiver = near_lake_framework::streamer(settings);
  ```
  to this instead:
  ```rust
  let (_, receiver) = near_lake_framework::streamer(settings);
  ```

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) - 2022-05-10

- Introduce `LakeConfigBuilder` for creating configs
  ```rust
  let config = LakeConfigBuilder.default()
    .testnet()
    .start_block_height(88220926)
    .build()
    .expect("Failed to build LakeConfig");
  ```
- Now you can provide custom AWS SDK S3 `Config`
  ```rust
  use aws_sdk_s3::Endpoint;
  use http::Uri;
  use near_lake_framework::LakeConfigBuilder;

  let aws_config = aws_config::from_env().load().await;
  let mut s3_conf = aws_sdk_s3::config::Builder::from(&aws_config);
  s3_conf = s3_conf
    .endpoint_resolver(
      Endpoint::immutable("http://0.0.0.0:9000".parse::<Uri>().unwrap()))
    .build();

  let config = LakeConfigBuilder::default()
    .s3_config(s3_conf)
    .s3_bucket_name("near-lake-data-custom")
    .start_block_height(1)
    .build()
    .expect("Failed to build LakeConfig");
  ```

### Breaking change

`LakeConfig` has a breaking change as we've removed `s3_endpoint` and added `s3_config`. Please, consider migrating to use `LakeConfigBuilder` instead of directly crafting the `Lakeconfig`
