/// #### Important notes on the Receipt
///
/// The original low-level Receipt is represented by the enum that differentiates between the Action and Data receipts. In turn this enum is a field
/// `receipt` in the parent `ReceiptView` struct.
/// Parent structure has a set of fields that are common for both Action and Data receipts.
/// During the simplification we have put the common fields into the [Receipt] struct itself and extracted the `actions` from Action Receipt into a separate struct.
/// Since the high-level NEAR Lake Framework update we encourage developers to create more actions-and-events oriented indexers instead.
