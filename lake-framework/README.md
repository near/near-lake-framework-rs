# NEAR Lake Framework

NEAR Lake Framework is a small library companion to [NEAR Lake](https://github.com/near/near-lake). It allows you to build
your own indexer that subscribes to the stream of blocks from the NEAR Lake data source and create your own logic to process
the NEAR Protocol data.

## Example

```no_run
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    near_lake_framework::LakeBuilder::default()
        .testnet()
        .start_block_height(112205773)
        .build()?
        .run(handle_block)?;
    Ok(())
}

// The handler function to take the `Block`
// and print the block height
async fn handle_block(
    block: near_lake_primitives::block::Block,
) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    eprintln!(
        "Block #{}",
        block.block_height(),
    );
#    Ok(())
}
```

### Pass the context to the function

```no_run
struct MyContext {
    my_field: String
}

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {

    let context = MyContext {
        my_field: "My value".to_string(),
    };

    near_lake_framework::LakeBuilder::default()
        .testnet()
        .start_block_height(112205773)
        .build()?
        .run_with_context(handle_block, &context)?;

    Ok(())
}

// The handler function to take the `Block`
// and print the block height
async fn handle_block(
    block: near_lake_primitives::block::Block,
    context: &MyContext,
) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    eprintln!(
        "Block #{} / {}",
        block.block_height(),
        context.my_field,
    );
#    Ok(())
}
```

## How to use

### AWS S3 Credentials

In order to be able to get objects from the AWS S3 bucket you need to provide the AWS credentials.

#### Passing credentials to the config builder

```rust
use near_lake_framework::LakeBuilder;

# fn main() {
let credentials = aws_credential_types::Credentials::new(
    "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
    "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
    None,
    None,
    "custom_credentials",
);
let s3_config = aws_sdk_s3::Config::builder()
    .credentials_provider(credentials)
    .build();

let lake = LakeBuilder::default()
    .s3_config(s3_config)
    .s3_bucket_name("near-lake-data-custom")
    .s3_region_name("eu-central-1")
    .start_block_height(1)
    .build()
    .expect("Failed to build LakeConfig");
# }
 ```

**You should never hardcode your credentials, it is insecure. Use the described method to pass the credentials you read from CLI arguments**

#### File-based AWS credentials
AWS default profile configuration with aws configure looks similar to the following:

`~/.aws/credentials`
```text
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

[AWS docs: Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

### Environmental variables

Alternatively, you can provide your AWS credentials via environment variables with constant names:

```text
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
$ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
$ AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1
```

### Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
...
[dependencies]
futures = "0.3.5"
itertools = "0.10.3"
tokio = { version = "1.1", features = ["sync", "time", "macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
tokio-stream = { version = "0.1" }

# NEAR Lake Framework
near-lake-framework = "0.8.0"
```

### Custom S3 storage

In case you want to run your own [near-lake](https://github.com/near/near-lake) instance and store data in some S3 compatible storage ([Minio](https://min.io/) or [Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) as example)
 You can owerride default S3 API endpoint by using `s3_endpoint` option

 - run minio

```bash
$ mkdir -p /data/near-lake-custom && minio server /data
```

 - pass custom `aws_sdk_s3::config::Config` to the [LakeBuilder]

```
use near_lake_framework::LakeBuilder;

# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() {
let aws_config = aws_config::from_env().load().await;
let mut s3_conf = aws_sdk_s3::config::Builder::from(&aws_config)
    .endpoint_url("http://0.0.0.0:9000")
    .build();

let lake = LakeBuilder::default()
    .s3_config(s3_conf)
    .s3_bucket_name("near-lake-data-custom")
    .s3_region_name("eu-central-1")
    .start_block_height(1)
    .build()
    .expect("Failed to build LakeConfig");
# }
```

## Configuration

Everything should be configured before the start of your indexer application via `LakeConfigBuilder` struct.

Available parameters:

 * [`start_block_height(value: u64)`](LakeConfigBuilder::start_block_height) - block height to start the stream from
 * *optional* [`s3_bucket_name(value: impl Into<String>)`](LakeConfigBuilder::s3_bucket_name) - provide the AWS S3 bucket name (you need to provide it if you use custom S3-compatible service, otherwise you can use [LakeConfigBuilder::mainnet] and [LakeConfigBuilder::testnet])
 * *optional* [`LakeConfigBuilder::s3_region_name(value: impl Into<String>)`](LakeConfigBuilder::s3_region_name) - provide the AWS S3 region name (if you need to set a custom one)
 * *optional* [`LakeConfigBuilder::s3_config(value: aws_sdk_s3::config::Config`](LakeConfigBuilder::s3_config) - provide custom AWS SDK S3 Config

## Cost estimates (Updated Mar 10, 2022 with more precise calculations)

**TL;DR** approximately $20 per month (for AWS S3 access, paid directly to AWS) for the reading of fresh blocks

### Historical indexing

| Blocks | GET | LIST | Subtotal GET | Subtotal LIST | Total $ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1000 | 5000 | 4 | 0.00215 | 0.0000216 | $0.00 |
| 86,400 | 432000 | 345.6 | 0.18576 | 0.00186624 | $0.19 |
| 2,592,000 | 12960000 | 10368 | 5.5728 | 0.0559872 | $5.63 |
| 77,021,059 | 385105295 | 308084.236 | 165.5952769 | 1.663654874 | $167.26 |

**Note:** ~77m of blocks is the number of blocks on the moment I was calculating.

**84,400 blocks is approximate number of blocks per day** (1 block per second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours)

**2,592,000 blocks is approximate number of blocks per months** (86,400 blocks per day * 30 days)

### Tip of the network indexing

| Blocks | GET | LIST | Subtotal GET | Subtotal LIST | Total $ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1000 | 5000 | 1000 | 0.00215 | 0.0054 | $0.01 |
| 86,400 | 432000 | 86,400 | 0.18576 | 0.46656 | $0.65 |
| 2,592,000 | 12960000 | 2,592,000 | 5.5728 | 13.9968 | $19.57 |
| 77,021,059 | 385105295 | 77,021,059 | 165.5952769 | 415.9137186 | $581.51 |

Explanation:

Assuming NEAR Protocol produces accurately 1 block per second (which is really not, the average block production time is 1.3s). A full day consists of 86400 seconds, that's the max number of blocks that can be produced.

According to the [Amazon S3 prices](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc1=h_ls) `list` requests are charged for $0.0054 per 1000 requests and `get` is charged for $0.00043 per 1000 requests.

Calculations (assuming we are following the tip of the network all the time):

```text
86400 blocks per day * 5 requests for each block / 1000 requests * $0.0004 per 1k requests = $0.19 * 30 days = $5.7
```
**Note:** 5 requests for each block means we have 4 shards (1 file for common block data and 4 separate files for each shard)

And a number of `list` requests we need to perform for 30 days:

```text
86400 blocks per day / 1000 requests * $0.005 per 1k list requests = $0.47 * 30 days = $14.1

$5.7 + $14.1 = $19.8
```

The price depends on the number of shards
